title: File Based Encryption

If you're a big android nerd in 2025, using a rooted android. You might assume root just straight up means unlimited access. You fire up your adb or a root shell if you are feeling fancy while your device is locked, try to list out some things from `/data/data` and see cyptic shit..

Here's what going on..

# FBE (File Based Encryption)
Modern android devices especially since android 10 and above applies FBE.
When your screen is locked, certain folders especially app data remain encrypted using a key that is only available after you unlock the screen.
So even if you're root, even if you're in ADB shell, even if you mount `/data` â€” you won't see the real data.
    Instead, you'll see files and folders that:

- Are either inaccessible.
- Or are present, but encrypted, meaning they're gibberish until the right key is provided.

This is the result while accessing `/data/data` in a locked device

This is the result while accessing `/data/data` in an unlocked device (used [iceraven-browser](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser) for example)

# Exceptions in directories
`/sdcard/`  or `data/media/0/`  these locations are device-encrypted only. It means you can access them even when the screen is locked.
They generally don't contain sensitive app data, most apps store their sensitive data in `data/data` .

# Bypassing the encryption when locked
(not sure, if you can get it to work totally)

1. Make a magisk module which detects when the screen is unlocked where the data gets copy files from `/data/data/(appname)` to `/data/media/0/(appbackup)`(well, this is not real-time access stuff, its a cache of data when unlocked)
2. Disable FBE(highly not recommended){it's just generally incompatible with new android APIs}

# How FBE works in precision 
Android uses [fscrypt](https://github.com/google/fscrypt), the Linux kernel feature than enables FBE:

(for basic understanding of CE keys and DE keys)

| Key Type | Unlock Time            | Access Level       | Example Uses                         |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| CE Key   | After user unlocks     | usr-specific/pvt   | messages, app datas                  |
| DE Key   | Immediately after boot | device-wide/public | incoming calls and lock screen notis |

- Every file has a metadata tag showing which encryption it uses
	(DE = Device Encryption & CE= Credential Encryption)
-  When you boot up your device, only DE keys are loaded.
- After you unlock your device, CE keys are loaded too.
- Files in `/data/data/` are tied to CE are still visible with `ls`, but unreadadble (`cat`,`grep`)becuz they are encrypted, After unlocking you can make them readable because the CE keys get finally loaded.
